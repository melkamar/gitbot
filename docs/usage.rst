How to use Gitbot
=================

Gitbot may be run in two ways:

- :ref:`console-usage`
   Runs as a console application, all issues are re-scanned and processed every couple of minutes (interval
   customizable). Easier to set up, no requirement on setting up GitHub (aside from credentials).
- :ref:`webapp-usage`
   Runs as a web application. GitHub repositories that should be processed need to be set up with :ref:`webhooks-label`.
   Application can either be run using embedded webserver, or deployed as s WSGi application.
